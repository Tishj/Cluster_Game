# CLUSTER

## - What?
A 1v1 game written in a week time, using C and the MLX42 (GLFW wrapper) library  
The game is made to be played by bots, in a turn based fashion.  
Each turn the bot receives input, and has X miliseconds to respond with a valid move  

Brief description:  
The game is similar to the popular game Connect 4, with the same goal; connect 4 tokens to win  
The twist is this is a hexagonal grid, and it's also possible to rotate this grid, which will make the tokens fall according to the new gravity

## - How?
PREREQUISITES:  
Need to have installed the requirements for MLX42 (found here https://github.com/W2Codam/MLX42)

INSTALLATION:  
`make`

USAGE:  
`./cluster BOT_PROGRAM_PATH1 [BOT_PROGRAM_PATH2]`  
The second path is optional, allowing you to play against a bot manually (without a timeout)

VALID MOVES:  
`PLACE column color`  
`ROTATE cycles`

If an invalid move is made, or a bot times out, the opposing player wins and the game is over.

## Mappings
`direction`  
0 - South  
1 - SouthWest  
2 - NorthWest  
3 - North  
4 - NorthEast  
5 - SouthEast  
## Input data

### Initialization Input

First line: `numberOfCells`  
Next `numberOfCells` lines: 7 space-separated integers:  
- `index` for the cell's index.  
- 6 `neigh` variables, one for each direction, containing the index of a neighboring cell or -1 if is there is no neighbor.  

Next line: An integer `numberOfColumns`
for `numberOfColumns` lines: 7 space-separated integers
- column number
- 6Â cellIndex variables, one for each direction, containing the index of the cell that is at the top of that column, for that direction.

Next line: An integer `yourColors`  
Next `yourColors` lines: 2 space-separated integers:
- `index` for the color's index.  
- `maxAmount` for the max amount of pellets of that color.  

Next line: An integer `opponentColors`  
Next `opponentColors` lines: 2 space-separated integers:
- `index` for the color's index.  
- `maxAmount` for the max amount of pellets of that color.  

### Input for One Game Turn
First line: An integer `direction` (between 0 and 5): the direction of gravity.  

Next line: `numberOfValidColumns`  
next `numberOfValidColumns` lines: 2 space-separated integers  
- `column`: the column to use for a PLACE command  
- `cellIndex`: the cell that correspond to the top of the column, according to the current gravity  

Next line: `numberOfNewPellets`  
next `numberOfNewPellets` lines: 4 space-separated integers:  
- `index`: index of the new pellet.  
- `cellIndex`: index of the cell the pellet is currently on.  
- `colorIndex`: index of the pellet's color.  
- `isMine`: 1 if you are the owner of this pellet, 0 otherwise.

Next line: `numberOfChangedPellets`  
next `numberOfChangedPellets` lines: 2 space-separated integers:  
- `index`: index of the pellet.   
- `cellIndex`: index of the cell the pellet is currently on.  

Next line: `numberOfPelletsInHand`
next `numberOfPelletsInHand` lines: 1 integer:
- `colorIndex`: index of the pellet's color.

## GAME END CONDITIONS

### Loss
If you run out of pellets  
If you timeout(bot only)  
If you make an invalid move  

### Win
Make a match bigger or equal to 4, and bigger than your opponent  
If both players have an equal size match, the amount of pellets they have on the board of their winning color will serve as tie-breaker  

### Tie
Both players have a match of equal size, with equal number of tiles of their winning color on the board  

Invalid moves:  
Move is not among the valid moves, or does not follow the correct format for the move  
PLACE command was done for a column that is already full  
Sending a command before reading all the input
